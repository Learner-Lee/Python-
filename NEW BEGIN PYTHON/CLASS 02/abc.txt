
The sun, not only from the sun, 
but also from our hearts. Have a heart of the sun, 
can see the bright side of the world; there is sunshine in the heart, 
with the wrong people heart to heart; the heart of sunshine, even in a sad day, 
will retain the warmth andenthusiasm; the heart of sunshine, can improve the quality of life. Self-confidence, 
tolerance, give, love, gratitude, let the heart of the sun, illuminate the little drops of life, the heart of the sun, 
the sun makes the fate.
